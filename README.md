#Array Methods

We can call methods on arrays the same way we do with strings.  
Because Ruby is so great, many of these methods speak for themselves. Team up with a partner and talk about what you think the following methods might return.		
###.first
	array = ["hello", "my", "friend]
	array.first

###.last
	fruit = ["apple", "orange", "pear", "banana"]
	fruit.last
	
###.reverse
	numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
	numbers.reverse
	
###.uniq
	sick_days= [4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 2, 4, 5, 1, 3]
	sick_days.uniq

###.size
	names = ["Emily", "Sherri", "Kai", "Josh"]
	names.size


###.shuffle
	cards = ["ace", "ten", "queen", "two"]
	cards.shuffle
